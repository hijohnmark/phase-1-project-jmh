# John Mark's P1 Project

Welcome to John Mark Harrell's Flatiron SE Flex Phase 1 project!

## Functionality

This app is a simple tool that allows you to search for your most hated monsters from the kingdom of hyrule as depicted in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. For a complete list of monsters in this game, visit https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Enemies_in_Breath_of_the_Wild

To add your favorite monster, simply type its name into the input field at the top of the page, then click "Add Monster" and voila! The horrible monster you searched for will appear in your collection.

Give the monster some hates by clicking the "Hate this monster" button. If you added a monster by mistake, or just don't feel that you hate it as much as you used to, click the "Remove from collection" button.

NOTE: monster queries must be spelled correctly, but they are not case sensitive.

## Roadmap

We have some amazing new features in the works for this project:

-A dropdown list of all monsters as an alternative method to find the monster you want to add to your collection.

-POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests to persist this app's interactivity, so you can keep your collection forever and ever.

-Prettier CSS formatting.

-More information about each monster in each card.
